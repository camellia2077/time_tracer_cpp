# Time Master

**Time Master** A lightweight markup language interpreter

A powerful toolset for personal time management and data visualization, designed to help you accurately track, analyze, and optimize your time.

This suite includes three core components:

  * **`Time_Master` (C++)**: The core command-line program, responsible for parsing raw logs, storing data in a database, and providing rich query and report exporting capabilities.
  * **`graph_generator` (Python)**: A data visualization tool capable of reading the database generated by `Time_Master` and creating various charts, such as daily timelines, activity heatmaps, etc.
  * **`log_generator` (C++)**: A convenient test data generator for quickly creating log files in the correct format.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Dependencies

Before you begin, please ensure your system has the following dependencies installed:

  * **C++ Components (`Time_Master`, `log_generator`)**:
      * **MSYS2 UCRT64** environment (Recommended for Windows)
      * **CMake** \>= 3.10
      * **GCC** (with C++23 support)
      * **SQLite3** library
      * **nlohmann/json** library
  * **Python Component (`graph_generator`)**:
      * **Python** \>= 3.8
      * **Matplotlib** library

### 2. Compilation & Installation

We provide a detailed compilation guide for all C++ components, including how to configure the MSYS2 UCRT64 environment and install necessary libraries.

➡️ **For detailed steps, please refer to: [Compilation Guide](./docs/compilation_guide.md)** *(You will need to create this file)*

### 3. Basic Usage Examples

Here are some common commands for the `Time_Master` CLI tool to give you a quick feel for its capabilities.

**Example 1: Full Data Processing**
(Validate Source -> Convert -> Validate Output -> Import to Database)

```bash
# Assuming your raw logs are in a "raw_logs" folder
time_tracker_cli -a "path/to/your/raw_logs"
````

**Example 2: Query a specific day's report**

```bash
# Query the daily report for July 21, 2025, in Markdown format
time_tracker_cli -q d 20250721 -f md
```

**Example 3: Query last month's report**

```bash
# Query the monthly report for June 2025, in LaTeX format
time_tracker_cli -q m 202506 -f tex
```
